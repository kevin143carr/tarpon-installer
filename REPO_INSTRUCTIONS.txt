The Key to using Tarpon Installer is preparation.  Here are the steps one should take when
building an install script on LINUX.
{LINUX ONLY}
1. Download the RPMs you going to use:
	use the getpackage.sh to download the RPMs you will need.  In the case of CentOS 7 you
	will need the 'Unzip' package at a minimum to unzip standard zipped files.
	
2.	Compress the repo on the RHEL/CentOS machine using – tar cvfz repo.tar.gz repo/  look at our repo.tar.gz for an example

3.	List the RPMs in the RPM section.  The key is the name, the value is the actual RPM.
4.  Make sure the installpkg.sh file is included in your resources folder.
5.  Tarpon will do the rest.
